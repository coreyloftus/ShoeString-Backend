## Introduction

Thanks for checking out ShoeString.

ShoeString is a digital guest book for Planet Earth -- an app where users can post about places they've physically traveled to, and share insider tips from their lived experiences there.

## What does it do?

ShoeString allows users to create posts containing a comment, latitude + longitude, tags, and images of their travels around the world. It then renders those posts in a feed. Users can also edit their comment body, or delete the post entirely.

    - Node.js
